# MallocDemoCS392

This is a demonstration of what can happen when you use `malloc` with the wrong size.

## Building

You need `gcc` and `make` to build. Simply run `make run` to compile and run. If you wish to only build, run `make build`.
Don't bother with `cmake`; that's here because I'm using CLion which uses it by default.

If you use this software to create a robot uprising, that's on you. I accept no responsibility for that.
